# Lifesteal
You can steal hearts from the players you kill!

Lifesteal is a plugin that lets you steal one of the hearts from the player you killed. You get one heart and the player loses one heart.

A player can also lose hearts if it wasn't killed by a player. So a player must be careful and not lose all their hearts otherwise they will be banned from the server!
